# Autonomous Robot Navigation
This project demonstrates an autonomous robot simulation using ROS2 and the NAV2 stack. The robot operates within a Gazebo environment and navigates autonomously, avoiding obstacles and reaching specified goals.

## Setup Instructions
To replicate this setup, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. Install ROS2 Humble.
2. Install NAV2 packages. Refer to the official ROS2 and NAV2 documentation for detailed installation instructions.

### Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rhian9843/Autonomous-Robot-Navigation.git
$ cd Autonomous-Robot-Navigation 
```
### Steps - SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
### 1. Install SLAM Toolbox
```sh
$ sudo apt install ros-humble-slam-toolbox
```
### 2. Launch the Robot Simulation
```sh
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```
This launches the Gazebo environment with your robot and predefined obstacles.

### 3. Control the Robot
Use the Robot Steering package to manually control the robot:
```sh
$ rqt_robot_steering
```
### 4. Start SLAM

Initialize the SLAM process with the command:
```sh
$ ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py use_sim_time:=True
```
### 5. Launch RViz

Open RViz to visualize the robot and its environment:
```sh
$ ros2 launch nav2_bringup rviz.launch.py
```
### Generate and Save the Map

Navigate the robot through the environment to create a map. Save the map using:
```sh
$ $ ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/my_map
```
Alternatively, you can use the slam_toolbox plugin in RViz to save the map. The map will be saved in the default terminal location.

### Steps - Navigation
### 1. Launch the Robot Simulation
Start the simulation again, if necessary:
```sh
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```
### 2. Launch the Navigation2 Stack

Start the main NAV2 launch file:
```sh
$ ros2 launch nav2_bringup bringup_launch.py map:=path/to/map.yaml
```
Add use_sim_time:=True if you are using Gazebo.
### 3. Launch RViz
Open RViz to set navigation goals:
```sh
$ ros2 launch nav2_bringup rviz.launch.py
```
### 4. Send Navigation Commands
In RViz, use the "2D Pose Estimate" button to set the initial position of the robot. Then, use the "2D Goal Pose" button to set the target destination for the robot.

### 5. Autonomous Navigation

The robot will navigate autonomously, following the path generated by the NAV2 stack while avoiding obstacles detected by its sensors. The path planning and obstacle avoidance are managed by the AMCL package for localization and the DWB local planner for safe path creation.
